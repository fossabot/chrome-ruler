# Chrome Ruler

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/ianwremmel/chrome-ruler.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

At the time I wrote this extension, there were 4 other ruler extensions in the Chrome Web Store. Two are adware supported (one without admitting it) and the other has too many features I didn't need.

## Installation

The easiest way to install this extension is via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en-US).

Follow the steps below to install from source.

1. Clone this project.
2. Visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in your browser.
3. Ensure that the **Developer mode** checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
4. Click **Load unpacked extensionâ€¦** to pop up a file-selection dialog.
5. Select the `dist` directory from the cloned project.
